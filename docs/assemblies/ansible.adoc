= Ansible variables

The list of ansible variables that can be set under `ansibleVars` is extensive.
To understand what variables are available for each service, see the
documentation in the <<create-openstackdataplaneservices,Create
OpenStackDataPlaneServices>> section.

Common configurations that can be enabled with `ansibleVars` are also
documented at xref:common_configurations.adoc[Common Configurations].

'''

*NOTE*

In the case of `ansibleVars`, the value is merged with that of the value from
the nodeTemplate. This makes it so that the entire value of `ansibleVars` from
the nodeTemplate does not need to be reproduced for each node just to set a few
node specific values.
