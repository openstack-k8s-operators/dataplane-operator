= Creating the data plane

:context: dataplane

[role="_abstract"]
The OpenStack DataPlane consists of CentOS nodes. Use the `OpenStackDataPlaneNodeSet` custom resource definition (CRD) to create the custom resources (CRs) that define the nodes and the layout of the data plane. You can use pre-provisioned nodes, or provision bare metal nodes as part of the data plane creation and deployment process.

To create and deploy a data plane, you must perform the following tasks:

. Create a `Secret` CR for Ansible to use to execute commands on the data plane nodes.
. Create the `OpenStackDataPlaneNodeSet` CRs that define the nodes and layout of the data plane.
. Create the `OpenStackDataPlaneDeployment` CRs that trigger the Ansible execution to deploy and configure software.

== Prerequisites

* A functional control plane, created with the OpenStack Operator.
* Pre-provisioned nodes must be configured with an SSH public key in the `$HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys` file for a user with passwordless `sudo` privileges.
* For bare metal nodes that are not pre-provisioned and must be provisioned when creating the `OpenStackDataPlaneNodeSet` resource:
** CBO is installed and configured for provisioning.
** `BareMetalHosts` registered, inspected, and have the label `app:openstack`.
* You are logged on to a workstation that has access to the RHOCP cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
