= Common Configurations

This page documents some of the common configurations that can be enabled
through ansible variables. The ansible variables that affect the configuration
of the ansible executions are set in the `ansibleVars` field on the dataplane
resources.

The full set of ansible variables available for configuration are documented
within each role in the
https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/edpm-ansible/tree/main/roles[edpm-ansible]
repository.

== Initial bootstrap command

*Variable*: `edpm_bootstrap_command`
*Type*: `string`
*Role*: https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/edpm-ansible/tree/main/roles/edpm_bootstrap[edpm_bootstrap]

The `edpm_bootstrap_command` variable can be used to pass a shell command(s) that
will be executed as early as possible in the deployment as part of the
`configure-network` service. If the `services` list is customized with services
that execute prior to `configure-network` then the command(s) specified by
`edpm_bootstrap_command` would run after the custom services.

The string value for `edpm_bootstrap_command` is passed directly to the ansible
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/shell_module.html[shell].
As such, when using multiple shell commands, the `|` character must be used to
preserve new lines in the `YAML` value:

 edpm_bootstrap_command: |
     command 1
     command 2
     etc.

=== Using `edpm_bootstrap_command` for system registration

`edpm_bootstrap_command` can be used to perform system registration in order to
enable needed package repositories. Choose a registration method (either Portal
or Satellite) and refer to the provided links below for instructions to create
the registration commands.

==== Red Hat Customer Portal registration

The registration commands for the Red Hat Customer Portal are documented at
https://access.redhat.com/solutions/253273.

==== Red Hat Satellite registration

The registration commands for Red Hat Satellite version 6.13 are documented at
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_satellite/6.13/html-single/managing_hosts/index#Registering_Hosts_to_Server_managing-hosts.

If not using Satellite version 6.13, then refer to the specific version of the
documentation for the version of Satellite that is in use.

=== Customizing container image locations

The container images used by the various roles from edpm-ansible can pull from
customized locations. The ansible variables used to set the locations and their
default values are:

 	edpm_iscsid_image: "quay.io/podified-antelope-centos9/openstack-iscsid:current-podified"
 	edpm_logrotate_crond_image: "quay.io/podified-antelope-centos9/openstack-cron:current-podified"
 	edpm_ovn_controller_agent_image: "quay.io/podified-antelope-centos9/openstack-ovn-controller:current-podified"
 	edpm_ovn_metadata_agent_image: "quay.io/podified-antelope-centos9/openstack-neutron-metadata-agent-ovn:current-podified"
 	edpm_frr_image: "quay.io/podified-antelope-centos9/openstack-frr:current-podified"
 	edpm_ovn_bgp_agent_image: "quay.io/podified-antelope-centos9/openstack-ovn-bgp-agent:current-podified"
 	telemetry_node_exporter_image: quay.io/prometheus/node-exporter:v1.5.0
 	edpm_libvirt_image: "quay.io/podified-antelope-centos9/openstack-nova-libvirt:current-podified"
 	edpm_nova_compute_image: "quay.io/podified-antelope-centos9/openstack-nova-compute:current-podified"
 	edpm_neutron_sriov_image: "quay.io/podified-antelope-centos9/openstack-neutron-sriov-agent:current-podified"
 	edpm_multipathd_image: "quay.io/podified-antelope-centos9/openstack-multipathd:current-podified"

Set any of the above ansible variables within the `ansibleVars` sections of
`OpenStackDataPlaneNodeSet` to customize the container image locations.

== Network Isolation

Network Isolation refers to the practice of separating network traffic by
function, and configuring the networks on dataplane nodes. Nodes will need
connectivity to various control plane services running on OCP. These services
may be bound to different networks. Each of those networks needs to be
configured as required on dataplane nodes.

For further details on the network architecture of the control plane, see
https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/docs/blob/main/networking.md.

=== Configuring networking with edpm_network_config

The
https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/edpm-ansible/tree/main/roles/edpm_network_config[edpm_network_config]
ansible role is responsible for configuring networking on dataplane nodes.

The `edpm_network_config_template` variable specifies the contents of a jinja2
template that describes the networking configuration to be applied. The
template itself also contains variables that can be used to customize the
networking configuration for a specific node (IP addresses, interface names,
routes, etc). See template examples provided in the nic-config-samples directory:
https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/dataplane-operator/config/samples/nic-config-samples.

These samples can be used inline within the `OpenStackDataPlaneNodeSet` CR
under then `ansibleVars` section (see our current sample files for examples
of the inline implementation).

The following is an example
<<ansibleopts,ansibleVars>>
field that shows defining the variables that configure the
`edpm_network_config` role.

 ansibleVars:
   edpm_network_config_template: templates/single_nic_vlans/single_nic_vlans.j2
   ctlplane_ip: 192.168.122.100
   internalapi_ip: 172.17.0.100
   storage_ip: 172.18.0.100
   tenant_ip: 172.19.0.100
   fqdn_internalapi: edpm-compute-0.example.com

This configuration would be applied by the
<<_dataplane_operator_provided_services,configure-network>> service when
it's executed.

=== Network attachment definitions

The
https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/docs/blob/main/networking.md#network-attachment-definitions[`NetworkAttachmentDefinition`]
resource is used to describe how pods can be attached to different networks.
Network attachment definitions can be specified on the
xref:openstack_dataplanenodeset.adoc[`OpenStackDataPlaneNodeSet`] resource using the
`NetworkAttachments` field.

The network attachments are used to describe which networks will be connected
to the pod that is running ansible-runner. They do not enable networks on the
dataplane nodes themselves. For example, adding the `internalapi` network
attachment to `NetworkAttachments` means the ansible-runner pod will be
connected to the `internalapi` network. This can enable scenarios where ansible
needs to connect to different networks.
