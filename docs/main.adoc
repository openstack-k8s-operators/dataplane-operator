= OpenStack Data Plane Operator
:toc: left
:toclevels: 5

The dataplane-operator automates the deployment of an OpenStack dataplane. A
dataplane is a collection of nodes that will be used for hosting OpenStack
workloads. The dataplane-operator prepares the nodes with enough operating
system configuration so that they are ready for hosting other required
OpenStack services and workloads.

See <<_contributing,contributing>> for notes for developers and
contributors, running the operator, building the documentation, etc.

See <<_dataplane_design,design>> for details about the dataplane design.

<<assembly_creating-the-data-plane,Creating a DataPlane>> documents how to create a dataplane.

The documentation source is kept within the dataplane-operator repo in the
https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/dataplane-operator/tree/main/docs[docs] directory. The full
generated documentation from that source is available at
https://openstack-k8s-operators.github.io/dataplane-operator/.
