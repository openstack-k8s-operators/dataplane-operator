# dataplane-operator

The dataplane-operator automates the deployment of an OpenStack dataplane. A
dataplane is a collection of nodes that will be used for hosting OpenStack
workloads. The dataplane-operator prepares the nodes with enough operating
system configuration so that they are ready for hosting other required
OpenStack services and workloads.

See [contributing](https://openstack-k8s-operators.github.io/dataplane-operator/contributing/) for notes for developers and
contributors, running the operator, building the documentation, etc.

See [design](https://openstack-k8s-operators.github.io/dataplane-operator/design/) for details about the dataplane design.

[Deploying a DataPlane](https://openstack-k8s-operators.github.io/dataplane-operator/deploying/) documents how to deploy a dataplane.

The documentation source is kept within the dataplane-operator repo in the
[docs](https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/dataplane-operator/tree/main/docs) directory. The full
generated documentation from that source is available at
<https://openstack-k8s-operators.github.io/dataplane-operator/>.
