# dataplane-operator
The dataplane-operator automates the deployment of an OpenStack dataplane

---
**NOTE**

The OpenStackDataPlane CRD/controller will eventually be moved to
[openstack-operator](https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operator/openstack-operator).
The move is so that openstack-operator, as the umbrella operator, remains the
single managing operator and UX for a complete OpenStack deployment
(control plane and data plane).

---

The dataplane-operator exposes the concepts of data plane role and nodes. These
are represented as CRD's within the operator:

* [OpenStackDataPlaneRole](https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/dataplane-operator/blob/main/config/crd/bases/core.openstack.org_openstackdataplaneroles.yaml)
* [OpenStackDataPlaneNode](https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/dataplane-operator/blob/main/config/crd/bases/core.openstack.org_openstackdataplanenodes.yaml)

The OpenStackDataPlaneRole CRD provides for a logical grouping of nodes of a
similar type within a role.  Similarities within a role are defined by the
user, and could be of a small scope (ansible port), or a large scope (same
network config, nova config, provisioning config, etc).

A role also provides for an inheritance model of node attributes. Attributes on
the role will automatically be inherited by the nodes on that role. Nodes can
also set their own attributes, which will override the inherited values from
the role.

The OpenStackDataPlaneRole controller creates and updates a node CR for each
node in that role. It also provides synchronization points as its nodes are
deployed.

The OpenStackDataPlaneNode CRD and controller encapsulates all the provisioning
and deployment logic for a single node. The OpenStackDataPlaneNode controller
operates on a single node CR, and manages that node in isolation, performing
all the necessary baremetal provisioning and software deployment/configuration
on that node.

The OpenStackDataPlane CRD and controller orchestrates deploying roles, and
provides synchronization points between role deployment.

## Description
// TODO(user): An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/dataplane-operator:tag
```

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/dataplane-operator:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing
// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/)
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
